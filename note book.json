    "Before addressing the specific questions, we will perform a preliminary analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions:**\n",
    "1.  **Load the Dataset:** Load the Boston Housing data into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "2.  **Descriptive Statistics:** Generate summary statistics for all variables using `.describe()`. This will give us the mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for each feature.\n",
    "3.  **Visualizations:**\n",
    "    * **Histograms:** Create histograms for key continuous variables like Median Value (MEDV), Nitric Oxide (NOX), and Distance to Employment Centres (DIS) to understand their distributions.\n",
    "    * **Box Plots:** Generate a box plot for Median Value (MEDV) to identify the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers."

    "\n",
    "**Analysis Approach:**\n",
    "The 'proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940' (AGE) is a continuous variable. To make it useful for group comparison, we should discretize it into categories (e.g., 'Low', 'Medium', 'High' proportion of old houses). This turns the question into a comparison of a continuous variable (MEDV) across three or more groups.\n",
    "\n",

    "    * **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant difference in the mean median house values across the different age proportion categories.\n",
    "    * **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** At least one age proportion category has a different mean median house value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visualization:** **Bar Chart or Box Plots**. A bar chart showing the mean MEDV for each age category with error bars would be effective. Alternatively, side-by-side box plots for each category can provide a more detailed view of the distributions."
